# Daily Planner

## Description
- At the start of the challenge a webpage containing the outline for a daily planner was inherited. The task was to construct a program that a user could used to save their daily plan. The program should also give the user the current date and time via blocks that change colours throughout the day.
- This type of program could benefit the user as it provides a simplistic way of planning out your day. Key events can be entered into each time block and saved such that when a user closer the program and reopens it, the events will appear in the corresponding spot without being deleted. This means that key information is not lost and users can set reminders without fear they may be deleted.
- Throughout this project I expanded my knowledge of javascript greatly. working with querySelectors taught me how easily webpages could be altered through simple javascript. Most importantly however, I learnt how to save an array via local storage which could subsequently be accessed to display pre-saved information. This was something that I had not managed to achieve in previous challenges.   

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
- This webpage is designed to act as a daily planner which can be used to hourly plan a day. The user can input a key event or message into any of the timeblocks and then press the save button to save the message. The user can also use the webpage to find the date and time at any point throughout the day. 
- The message can be any length, so the user can input as much detail as they want, allowing the webpage to be used as anything from a short bullet pointed calender to a detailed daily journal.
